# AI-based-interaction-system
This project presents an interactive robot system that integrates real-time object detection, face recognition, and user interaction through a chatbot. The system is designed to provide a robust and dynamic platform for various interactive applications, including security, customer service, and entertainment.

Components
Object Detection:

Model: YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3)
Details: YOLOv3 is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection model that is capable of detecting multiple objects in an image with high accuracy. It uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images. For this project, YOLOv3 is utilized to continuously monitor the environment via a webcam and detect objects. When a person is identified in the frame for a sustained period, it triggers the face recognition process.
Face Recognition:

Pretrained Model: FaceNet
Details: FaceNet is a deep learning model developed by Google for face recognition. It generates 128-dimensional embeddings (vector representations) of faces, which can be used to compare and identify individuals. The embeddings are used to determine the similarity between the detected face and those stored in a database.
Classifier: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Details: An SVM model is trained on the embeddings generated by FaceNet to classify and identify individuals. This classifier is used to match the embeddings of the detected face with those in the pre-existing face database.
Chatbot Interaction:

Implementation: Chatbot class
Details: The chatbot component is implemented in the Chatbot class. It enables interactive communication with the recognized user by providing responses based on predefined logic or by integrating with natural language processing (NLP) services. This interaction can be tailored to different applications, such as answering questions or providing information.
User Management:

Functionality: Adding and Updating Users
Details: The system supports dynamic user management, allowing the addition of new users by capturing their facial data and augmenting the face database. This ensures that the face recognition model remains up-to-date with new individuals.
Integration and Workflow
The system seamlessly integrates these components to deliver a real-time interactive experience:

Real-time Monitoring: The webcam continuously captures video frames and applies YOLOv3 for object detection.
Face Detection: Upon detecting a person, FaceNet extracts facial embeddings for recognition.
Face Identification: The SVM classifier identifies the person based on the embeddings and matches them against the stored database.
User Interaction: Recognized users interact with the system through the chatbot, which engages them in conversation and provides responses as needed.
User Management: New users can be added to the system, and their data is used to update the face recognition model.
